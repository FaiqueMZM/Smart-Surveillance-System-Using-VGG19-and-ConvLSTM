# Smart-Surveillance-System-Using-VGG19-and-ConvLSTM
Deep Learning (Final Year Project)

Video surveillance using human resources requires a large amount of attention and well-trained individuals to attain perfect consistency. 
Therefore, systems are being developed to make video surveillance easy and efficient. 
The proposed solution is based on VGG19, which is a convolutional neural network (CNN) used for extracting features from frames and ConvLSTM, which is a recurrent neural network (RNN) used for detecting violence in extracted frames. 
Deep learning techniques enable automated systems to analyze video footages accurately detecting instances of violence. 
These models are capable of learning from enormous volumes of labeled data and can distinguish between peaceful and violent activities by using properties including motion, object interactions, and contextual cues. 
The proposed model uses ConvLSTM instead of LSTM to extract spatiotemporal features better to increase efficiency and accuracy. 
In this research, the proposed model is trained and tested with benchmark Hockey Fight Dataset and achieved an accuracy of 70% during testing process.
